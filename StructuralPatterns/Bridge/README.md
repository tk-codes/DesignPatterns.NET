# Bridge

**Bridge** pattern lets you split a big class into two separate hierachies, abstraction and implementation so that the two can vary independently.

## Problem

* An abstraction and its implementation should be defined and extended independently from each other.
* A compile-time binding between an abstraction and its implementation should be avoided so that an implementation can be selected at run-time.

When using subclassing, different subclasses implement an abstract class in different ways (eg. `Shape <- Sqaure <- BlueSquare/RedSquare`). But an implementation is bound to the abstraction at compile-time and can't be changed at run-time.

## Solution

The Bridge pattern attempts to solve it by replacing inheritance with delegations. 

* Separate an abstraction from its implementation by putting them in separate class hierarchies.
* Implement the abstraction in terms of (by delegating to) an `Implementor` object.

This enables to configure an `Abstraction`(Interface) with an `Implementor`(Interface) object at run-time.

## Benefits

* Decouples an implementation so that it is not bound permanently to an interface.
* Abstraction and implementation can be extended independently.
* Changes to the concrete abstraction classes don't affect the client.
* Allows building platform independent code
* Hides the implementation details from client

## Drawbacks

* Increases overall code complexity by creating multiple additional classes.

## Known Uses

* Useful in graphic and windowing systems that need to run over multiple platforms
* Useful any time you need to vary an interface and an implementation in different ways

## Common Structure

![Common structure of bridge pattern](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Bridge_UML_class_diagram.svg/500px-Bridge_UML_class_diagram.svg.png)

* Abstraction
  * defines the abstraction's interface
  * maintains a reference to an object of type `Implementor`.
* RefinedAbstraction
  * extends the interface defined by `Abstraction`.
* Implementor
  * defines the interface for implementation class. This interface doesn't have to correspond exactly to the `Abstraction`'s interface. Typically the implementation interface provides only primitive operations, and Abstraction defines higher-level operations based on these primitives.
* ConcreteImplementor
  * implements the `Implementor` interface.

**Usage**

```csharp
        // Abstraction-Implementation combination 1 =>  Smart TV + Physical Remote
        var smartTv = new SmartTv();
        var physicalRemote = new PhysicalRemote(smartTv);
        physicalRemote.PowerOn();
        physicalRemote.VolumeUp();
        physicalRemote.PowerOff();
        
        // Abstraction-Implementation combination 2 =>  Smart TV + Smart App Remote
        var smartAppRemote = new SmartAppRemote(smartTv);
        smartAppRemote.PowerOn();
        smartAppRemote.VolumeUp();
        smartAppRemote.PowerOff();
        
        // Abstraction-Implementation combination 3 =>  Normal TV + Physical Remote
        var normalTv = new NormalTv();
        var physicalRemote2 = new PhysicalRemote(normalTv);
        physicalRemote2.PowerOn();
        physicalRemote2.VolumeUp();
        physicalRemote2.PowerOff();
```

## Comparison with other patterns

* **Adapter** makes the unrelated classes work together. Adapter makes things work after they're designed; Bridge is designed beforehand to let the abstraction and implmentation vary independently. *[GoF, p219]*
